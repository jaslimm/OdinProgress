        <!-- creating links -->
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me!</a>

        <!-- target attribute specifies where the link is opened.
        _self is opened in current tab
        _blank is opened in new tab -->


        <!-- <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank">i open in new tab</a></p> -->


        <!-- rel attributes describes the relation between current page and the linked document. strengthens security
        
        noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened
    
        noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or 'reference') to it
    
        if u have TARGET _blank attribute u should be fine tho
    
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" -->

        <!-- ABSOLUTE and RELATIVE LINKS

        abolute link : protocol://domain/path
        links to pages on other websites. always contains protocol and domain
